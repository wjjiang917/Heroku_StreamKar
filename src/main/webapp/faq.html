                      <h3>1. How do I start streaming?</h3>
               <p>Just click the camera in the upper right-hand corner of the app main page. If you haven’t already, you will be asked to go through a verification process. After submitting your documents and information, your information will be forward to our talent agency for approval. If approved, you will be notified. After this, hit the camera button and you will be ready to go live.</p>
               <h3>2. How do I get more viewers in my live stream?</h3>
               <p>The best way to gain viewers in your broadcast is to:</p>
               <p>• Promote your broadcasts by sharing the link on other social networks, 
                  such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat, and invite your 
                  friends to watch before you go live.
               </p>
               <h3>3. How do I delete a replay that I created?</h3>
               <p>To delete a recording, you need to go to your profile page, click “My 
                  recording”, tap the recording at the top right corner and select 
                  "delete."
               </p>
               <h3>4. There are too many comments. Can I remove them?</h3>
               <p>You can swipe across the screen from the left to the right to clear all information pertaining to comments and gifts.</p>
               <h3>5. Why is my camera or mic not working?</h3>
               <p>You must give Streamkar permission to use your camera and/or microphone on 
                  your mobile device. Please go to Settings –&gt; Streamkar –&gt; Privacy, 
                  and make sure both camera and microphone are enabled.

                      <h3>1. How do I buy Coins?</h3>
               <p>You may purchase coins by visiting your profile page and tapping on 
                  “Coins”. You can also purchase by tapping on the gift box icon in a 
                  broadcast and then choosing the “Charge” option. 
               </p>
               <h3>2. What are Coins and Diamonds?</h3>
               <p>Coins are the Streamkar currency. Viewers and broadcasters can buy coins and 
                  use them to purchase gifts or do coin drops to interact with one 
                  another. When viewers send you gifts, you immediately earn the same 
                  number of diamonds as the item cost to purchase in the Streamkar Gift 
                  Store. Once you have enough diamonds, you can cash them out for real 
                  money or convert them back into coins. For a tutorial, please visit: 
                  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_dmDvFdb3Y
               </p>
               <h3>3. I bought coins, but never received them!</h3>
               <p>If you have purchased coins on Streamkar but they have not showed up in your
                  account, we are happy to help. Please provide us the receipt from 
                  either the App Store or Google Play store as well as a screenshot of 
                  your profile page for us to track your order quickly.
               </p>
               <h3>4. Why have some gift options disappeared from the Gift Shop?</h3>
               <p>We have many gift ideas, but due to the limited availability of the gift 
                  shop slots, we may replace some gifts with new ones from time to time. 
                  Please try out the new ones that are equally fun!
               </p>
               <h3>5. Why was my withdrawal request rejected?</h3>
               <p>It can be due to a variety of reasons.</p>
               <p>1.The
                  Paypal account you provided is either incorrect or unregistered. Please
                  check and try again. Always provide your email associated with your 
                  PayPal instead of the phone number.
               </p>
               <p>2.Each user can withdraw a maximum of US$600 per day. Please wait until the next day to submit another request.</p>
               <p class="no-jp">For a tutorial, please visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LywB4RNW61M</p>
               <h3>6. What is a coin drop/giveaway?</h3>
               <p>A coin drop is the Treasure Chest gift item, but unlike a normal gift, 
                  this allows for coins to be distributed amongst the audience. You can 
                  start a coin drop at the cost of 600 coins during anyone's broadcast, 
                  including yours. The 600 coins will be won by and randomly distributed 
                  to the first ten users in the same broadcast who click the "Snatch" 
                  button. 
               </p>
               <h3>7S. Only a few people participated in my coin drop. Are my coins wasted/lost?</h3>
               <p>You can take a look at the coin drop results page to find out who the lucky
                  winners are. All coins that are not claimed within 24 hours will be 
                  automatically returned to the original coin dropper. 
               </p>
               <h3>8. When can I receive my cash out money?</h3>
               <p>In addition to Streamkar's internal auditing process, some payment requests 
                  may also be subject to PayPal's 21-day temporary hold. Please allow at 
                  least 30 days for your payment to go through completely. 
               </p>
               <h3>9. What can I do with my diamonds I earn while streaming?</h3>
               <p>When another user or a talent sends you a gift, you will receive diamonds. These diamonds can be exchanged in-app for virtual currency coins. Find the prompt for exchanging diamonds to coins on the “Me” page by clicking the “Earnings”box. 
               </p>
               <h3>10. As a user, can I convert the coins I have earned to real-life currency?</h3>
               <p>Sorry. We currently do not support this function. If you would like to cash out your coins for the real-life currency of your country/region, you must first become a StreamKar talent and have signed with an officially recognized StreamKar agency. If you so desire, please contact our customer service and we will help. We look forward to it. 
               </p>
               <h3>11. As a signed talent, when can I receive my gift revenue?</h3>
               <p>Generally, at StreamKar, we will pay gift revenue for a previous month within 5 working days of the beginning of the subsequent month.
               </p>
               <p>
               	* However, if any of the various payment platforms supported by StreamKar delay the funds for any reason, we will wait until those funds clear to complete the requested transaction. 
               </p>
               <p>
               	*If a user seeks refund of funds spent through Apple Pay within the 3 month clearance period, the virtual currency amount corresponding to the requested refund amount will be frozen and deducted from any talent that has received virtual currency gifts sent using the refunded funds. As deemed necessary, certain payment methods may be temporarily discontinued or virtual coin distribution will be paid on a by-stage basis to protect against malicious refund requests.

                      <h3>1. As a talent, when I send a cash bag, how many bags are being sent out?</h3>
               <p>The talent cash bag is different than the user cash bag in that the talent cash bag cannot select amount being sent out. The amount of bags that will be sent is just a random amount for talents
               </p>   
               <h3>2. What is a horn cash bag?</h3>
               <p>Selecting the “horn” option to accompany your cash bag will allow the cash bag to appear above any other cash bags and messages on the screen. Ideally, this option can be used during a time that many cash bags are being sent so you can be noticed and appreciated by other fans and talents
               </p>
               <h3>3. What does “Quantity” mean in the cash bag menu?</h3>
               <p>Quantity refers to the number of cash bags that users will be able to grab. The total amount you wish to send will be divided randomly among the quantity of bags you send out. For instance, if you send 10,000 coins with a quantity of 15 bags, that means your 10,000 coins will be divided among 15 bags and that 15 users each can get a portion of those 10,000 coins.
