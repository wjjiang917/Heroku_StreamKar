                                    and to identify registered users using saved StreamKar community cookies.
                                </li>

                                <li>The StreamKar community uses website beacons to collect data for partner websites;
                                    relevant data is also used for statistical purposes.

                                <li>When the StreamKar community places website beacons to collect data for our partners, we
                                    require our partners to inform users on their privacy policy page that the webpage uses

                                    containing images) to count the number of opened messages.
                                </li>
                                <li>Typically, electronic images are considered to be part of the webpage and, including
                                    banner ads, can all be used as beacons. Therefore, beacons can be added to all
